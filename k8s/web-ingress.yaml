# The Secret with the Let's Encrypt certificate is automatically created
# when deploying the above Ingress yaml. You don't need to create a yaml file
# with the secret yourself.
#
# Creating the certificate takes a few minutes.
#
# Obviously this only works if the domain name referenced is in the "real"
# DNS system and resolves to 194.171.4.29
#
# You can check the secret's existence with kubectl:
#
# $ kubectl -n tci-momfer get secret momfer
# NAME      TYPE                DATA      AGE
# momfer    kubernetes.io/tls   3         24d
#
# and "get secret momfer -o yaml" returns the yaml version.
